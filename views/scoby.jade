        p SCOBY's are used to ferment Kombucha.

        p Kombucha is a fermented tea beverage dating back to 212 BC, during the
            | Tsin dynasty of China. Fermentation is driven by a SCOBY. Yeast
            | consumes sugar and produces alcohol which bacteria consume to produce
            | acetic acid. This process creates other nutrients and probiotic
            | enzymes. The yeast also produce carbon dioxide, which can be used to
            | carbonate the drink.

        p The probiotics in kombucha promote healthy digestive tracts and immune
            | systems. They assist in the breakdown of food and help maintain the
            | natural balance of microflora in the intestines.

        h4 Lifestyle

        p During the fermentation, the 'mother' SCOBY will grow a baby, which
            | can then be used, thrown away, or&nbsp;
            a(href="/have") given
            |  to a friend or stranger! The mother will last for years with
            | proper care.

        p Commercial kombucha can be quite pricey, but brewing your own is very
            | affordable once you have acquired a SCOBY.

        h4 Brewing

        p Ingredients required are sugar, water, a SCOBY with some fermented
            | active kombucha, and tea. Be sure to use real tea,&nbsp;

            | : black, green, white pekoe, oolong, Djareeling, and others will work.

        h5 Steps

        ol
            li Boil water.
            li Add sugar and tea.
            li Steep to desired strength (about 10 minutes).
            li Pour into glass container and cool to room temperature. (This
                | takes a while, but will prevent killing your SCOBY.)
            li Add SCOBY and the kombucha it's in.
            li Cover with a paper towel or cheesecloth and secure. You want a
                | breathable container that can prevent mold spores and bugs from
                | entering.
            li Store at room temperature out of direct sunlight for six to ten days.
            li Move SCOBY along with some kombucha (for later brewing) to a storage jar.
            li After straining (if you want), your kombucha is ready! You can
                | either flavor it, drink it, or do a secondary fermentation.
